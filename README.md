# Bordle
A Wordle clone I built using React and Redux because I was bored.

I got the list of possible words off some crappy website that only showed 500 5 letter words. If you want to add to the list, feel free to edit [`src/utils/words/validWords.ts`](https://github.com/kobili/bordle/blob/main/src/utils/words/validWords.ts) and open up a PR.

The source code makes me cringe too ðŸ˜†


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
